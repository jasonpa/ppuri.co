Bring power back to the people.
The few that hold power have corrupted this world in their image.

We want to open a new future.
State or market is the old frame.
It is a deception.

Future is in the past.
Community is where people live.
Land is where people stand.

Stop poisoning nature.
Stop destroying the people.

All life needs to live in its perfection.
Health, vitality, and spirituality.
Restore natural healing and cultivations.

People need to see the truth to act.
People need to connect to be powerful.
People need to return to land, to productivity.

Awaken. Connect. Return.
