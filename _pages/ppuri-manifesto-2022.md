# Founding of Ppuri People Power

Acquiring food, fuel, fabric, and shelter from the land is an unchanging feature of human existence. Land is the source of our life energy and foundation of our wealth and self-reliance. That is why history was a scheme to detach the people from the land. To the extent that this displacement was successful, we were enslaved.

Property, tenancy, tax, and registration have changed little throughout history to continue to function today as an effective means to block the desperate man’s access to the land, and thus to life energy and sovereignty. To abolish this or to purport to do so might be infeasible but to remember that the land is the root to where we shall return and to transition to a way of living where we are blessed by the land and not by the government – is feasible.

The choices and means of life that we are given with – and dare not step out of – are not meant for our happiness, prosperity, or justice, but as processes to build a new world, new order, new human. What is this new world? For whom is it being constructed? Who is building it? At least we know the answer to the last question. We are building our prison with our own hands.

Power is theft. Power is formed when people submit their powers by will or swindle. Taking by force or deceit is robbery, exercising more than what has been conferred is violence. Following the threats of communists, rogue states, terrorists, and viruses, the regimes of national security, homeland security, and biosecurity have been consecutively placed. Following the fearmongering, people renounced freedom and handed over their power. While reassuring us that democracy assures people’s power, the whole world turned into a police state, coercing increasingly elevating levels of invasive measures into our flesh and thoughts. The ultimate security regime is “mind security” where the Leviathan will protect itself from the very thoughts of resistance and rebellion. This signals the total surveillance and destruction of our reason and mental function. Seizing the mind is the completion of control, the end of history.

Humans can now create matter (nano), create mind and intelligence (info), create life (bio), create machine-linked cognition (cogno), and thus create the new human, the transhuman. Ethics debate will be humiliated as technology continues its runaway. When the weapons and surveillance systems of the future are deployed, we will envy the dead.

Instinct of the state is to war, of the government is to dictate, of the market to monopolize. Of all things, has institution ever reined over the instinct? Politicians do not give us power; they take. Corporations do not give us wealth; they take. Law does not protect our freedom; they take. Are these the reliable means of realizing our dignity and liberty?
This is not to insist the abolishment of the state, but to pursue a state where we can live without the state. We cannot find the post-state future human in a machine-man maximized of its functions through artificial intelligence and robotics, but in a spiritual being emanating in wisdom and love. For that is what makes human noble, what it means to be human.
This is not to promote lawlessness (anomie) but to dare to step outside the narrowness of State Law. The ultimate law is Natural Law or Conscience Law which is the voice of Heaven. Before begging for equality before the law, people should demand equality with the law.

This is not to remove markets but to remove the obstacles to positive functions of the market. Let’s grow self-reliance so that people may be safe against the tricks of the market.
Democracy within the state is a parochial view. Let us bring the state within democracy. If the rule of all is not successful, there will come the rule of one.

Let us dream, but not only dream, let us live the Perfect Life where free, self-reliant, and sovereign individuals associate, rooted deep into the Earth, spirit aloft into the Heaven, healing the self, the society, and the land itself. We are farming for freedom.

Ego covers the wisdom of the true-self. State covers the peace of the villages. Civilization covers the affluence of nature. It would be erroneous to strive to build a new self, a new community, or a new natural system. We only need to return to the root. Already perfect, there is nothing to fight for or acquire. Always perfect, there is nothing to fix or add. All we are to do is to uncover, discover, and recover what is. If you empty, utopia is right here right now.

One, Ppuri will heal the soil by spreading farming knowledge and other appropriate technologies that reduce cost and strengthen communities.
Two, Ppuri will heal the person by spreading natural healings for the body and mind and methods of cultivation that extend the physical, emotional, and spiritual dimensions.
Three, Ppuri will heal the society by spreading knowledge of truth to strengthen justice, freedom, and happiness.

As much as our planet’s land, water, and air have been contaminated, so too have people been poisoned, broken, and imperiled. We do not even have time to subvert the old world. Let us get straight into the work of opening a new universe.
